# Traffic Congestion Management Using AI and Digital Twin Technology

## Overview

This system provides a cost-effective, globally portable solution for real-time traffic congestion detection and short-term prediction at the junction level. By leveraging publicly available data sources (OpenStreetMap and Google Maps Directions API), it eliminates the need for expensive sensor infrastructure while maintaining operational accuracy.

### Key Features

-   **Global Portability** — Configure any geographic area via bounding box coordinates
-   **Junction-Level Granularity** — Spatial clustering of traffic signals
-   **Real-Time Detection** — Congestion Factor (CF) computation from free-flow vs. in-traffic ETAs
-   **Short-Horizon Prediction** — Gradient Boosting model for +5 minute forecasts
-   **Digital Twin Integration** — SUMO-based simulation for visualisation and what-if testing
-   **API Efficiency** — Pairwise sampling with pruning reduces API calls by ~98%
